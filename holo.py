# Gemini Voice Assistant
#
# This program listens for a specific key press ('a'), records an audio command,
# sends it to the Gemini Flash model for a response, and then uses text-to-speech
# to voice the reply.

# --- Installation ---
# Before running, you need to install the required Python libraries.
# Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
# pip install google-generativeai speechrecognition keyboard gtts playsound==1.2.2 PyAudio
